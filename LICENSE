### Specific Changes:

1. **License Badge Update**:
   - Updated the license badge to explicitly state "MIT License" using:  
     `<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-4169E1style=for-the-badge" alt="MIT License">`.
   - Kept the original color (`https://github.com/crwg/crwg.github.io/blob/master/.githubLICENSE`) for consistency and linked it to the LICENSE file.
   - Standardized to `style=for-the-badge` to match the other badges in the first set.

2. **Unified Badge Style**:
   - Changed the second set of badges (JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, Last Commit) from `style=flat-square` to `style=for-the-badge` for a cohesive look across all badges.
   - Added links to relevant resources for the tech stack badges (e.g., JavaScript to `https://www.javascript.com/`, HTML5 to MDN's HTML docs, etc.) to make them more interactive, which is a common in GitHub READMEs.
   - Ensured the Last Commit badge links to the commit history for usability.

3. **Preserved Layout and Colors**:
   - Kept the original colors (e.g., `#FFD700` for Stars, `#F7DF1E` for JavaScript) to maintain the vibrant aesthetic of your README.
   - Maintained the two separate `<p align="center">` blocks to group badges logically: GitHub stats and demos in one, tech stack and last commit in another.

4. **Additional Fixes in Matrix Section** (since you included it):
   - Fixed typos and formatting issues in the "Matrix Digital Rain" section:
     - Corrected "Inspired inspired" to "inspired."
     - Fixed "rain rain" to "character rain."
     - Corrected "HTML5 Canvas" to "HTML5 Canvas" (removed stray comma).
     - Fixed "Scalable" to "Scales."
     - Updated "Licensed under the MIT License" to just "MIT License" for brevity.
     - Fixed broken link for "Explore Code": Changed to `https://github.com/crwg/crwg.github.io/tree/master/matrix`.
     - Corrected image syntax for the Matrix screenshot: `<a href="assets/matrix.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="assets/matrix.jpg" alt="Matrix Screenshot" width="480" style="border-radius: 10px; margin: 24px; border: 1px solid #aaa"/></a>`.

5. **Get Started Section Fix**:
   - Corrected the clone URL: `https://github.com/crwg/crwg.github.io.git` (fixed "crwg.github.io" to "crwg/crwg.github.io").
   - Fixed "CloneClone" to "Clone" and "cd crwg.github.io" to match the correct directory.

### Notes:
- The updated badges are now all in `for-the-badge` style, creating a bold, uniform look that aligns with modern GitHub READMEs.
- The MIT license is clearly indicated in the badge and links to your LICENSE file.
- If you prefer `flat-square` for all badges instead, let me know, and I can adjust them accordingly.
- I preserved the rest of your READMEâ€™s structure, including images and sections, and only made necessary fixes for clarity and functionality.
- If you want to add a dedicated "License" section in the README (e.g., with a brief description of the MIT license), I can help with that too!

Let me know if you need further tweaks or additional badge suggestions!
